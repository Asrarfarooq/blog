**Introduction:**
Hey there fellow Cloud Engineers! Are you tired of your infrastructure costs spreading like wildfire across multiple services? Fear not; we're about to tackle the beast called cost attribution using Terraform tags, ensrancingly unravel its secrets and putting it back into our command center.

**Why This Matters:**
The ability to accurately attribute infrastructure costs is paramount for any organization aiming at efficient resource management within cloud environments such as AWS or Azure. Without proper attributions, we risk misallocating resources leading to unnecessary expenses and potential service degradation due to over-provisioned services without realizing it's happening!

**Technical Deep Dive:** 
Understanding cost allocation requires a clear grasp of tagging strategies in Terraform. Tags are key/value pairs that help categorize resources based on attributes like environment, owner or purpose within the AWS ecosystem - this is vital for managing and billing purposes accurately! Let's dive into how we can implement effective cost allocation using tags:
1. Define consistent tagging conventions across your Terraform configurations to avoid ambiguity in resource categorization; always use lowercase alphanumeric characters separated by hyphens (e.g., "environment-us-east").
2. Utilize the AWS provider’s built-in cost allocation tags feature, which allows you to define custom tag keys and values that get associated with your resources during deployment - this enables precise tracking of costs for specific applications or services within different environments; e.g., 'project:myapp', ‘environment':staging'.
3. Implement a Terraform module dedicated solely to cost attribution using tags in all deployed infrastructure, ensuring that every resource is consistently tagged according to our established conventions - this provides a centralized way of managing and auditing costs effectively; e.g., for an EC2 instance:
```terraform
resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
  ami           = var.ami
  subnet_id      = var.subnet_id
  vpc_security_group_ids = [var.sg_id]
  
  tags = merge(
    datacenter().tags, # Assume this returns a map of predefined common tags for the entire AWS account/region like 'environment':staging' and more...
    { environment      = "production", project       = var.project },
  )
}
```
4. Automate periodic cost reports by leveraging services such as CloudWatch or third-party tools, filtering billing information based on tagged resources to generate detailed cost breakdowns; for example: 'aws_cloudwatch_cost_allocation' resource which filters all costs associated
