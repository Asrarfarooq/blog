import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def process_data(input_data):
    """Process and transform input data."""
    logger.info(f"Processing {len(input_data)} items")
    return [item.upper() for item in input_data]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    data = ["example", "data", "here"]
    result = process_data(data)
    print(f"Result: {result}")
```
